# Welcome to the tensorflow2_beginner!
Are you new to deep learning? Do you want to learn deep learning techniques with one of the most popular frameworks? If you are eager to quickly learn how to use tensorflow2 (TF2) to train deep learning models to solve your real world problems. Don't miss our course of TF2 for beginners. 

## What do we offer in this course (11 episodes).
This course includes 11 episodes of online tutorials. The first one is the introduction to this course. In rest of tutorials, you will find corresponding course materials including comprehensive code implementations with detailed explanations in this GitHub repository. The course covers three main topics:

### 1. How to create a deep learning environment:
In the second tutorial, you will learning how to create a deep learning environment including virtual environment, and Jupyter notebook setups, and cuda and tensorflow installation.

### 2. How to build your own neural networks using TF2:
This part will start with introducing basic methods to implement your own neural network structures. Then in the next 6 tutorials. You will learn how to use TF2 to process three types of input data, and build three classical neural networks to solve three classification tasks:
 
1. Structured Data Classification - this task is covered by two tutorials. They demonstrate how to solve the classical iris classification problem with structured data (tabular data in a CSV file). You will learning structured data processing, and how to implement and train a simple ANN model.

2. Image Classification - again, same as the previous task. We also designed two tutorials for this task. In the first tutorial, you will know how to process images using TF2. Then, in the second one, it shows how to train a CNN model to classify a image whether it 
illustrates a cat or dog.

3. text classification - in the next two tutorials, we focus on text processing. You will learn how to create a RNN model for sentiment analysis.

### 3. How to save, load and evaluate your model
This part is covered by the last three tutorials.  

## What we focus on

### Hands on practices using TF2, No formula! No theoretical knowledge!

### The shortest path to launch a training process.

### The most commonly used TF2 APIs in practical projects.
